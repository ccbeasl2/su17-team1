## **Team Charter** 
#### **Broad Team Goals**
1. Work effectively as a team.
2. Create an instructional document that clearly explains how first-year students can use an open-source tool. 

#### **Measurable Team Goals** 
1. Complete all required deliverables for the project.  
2. Adhere to the project specifications set forth by the instructor. 
3. Meet or beat all assignment deadlines. 
4. Have 15 or fewer grammatical/mechanical errors in the final deliverable document. 

#### **Personal Goals**
* Allison: I hope to improve my technical writing skills, learn to write in Markdown, and familiarize myself with GitHub. 
*	Camille: I hope to meet all deadlines, write as clearly and effectively as possible, and meet page/word count. 
*	Gabriella: I hope to learn how to effectively communicate through online platforms and more efficiently meet my audiences' needs. I also hope to enhance my technical writing skills. 

#### **Individual Commitment** 
* Allison: As team leader, I am willing to give 100% effort. I will do my best to make sure that all our assignments are completed on-time. 
* Camille: I am willing to do whatever is asked of me and whatever is necessary to complete the assignment with great quality. 
* Gabriella: I agree to meet all deadlines and to participate efficiently to produce the best quality work. 

#### **Other Concerns**
*	We have never worked with GitHub before, so it will take some time to become familiar with the platform. 
*	Since our course is online, it will take extra effort for our team to communicate and work together effectively. 

#### **Conflict Resolution** 
* If conflicts arise, we will first discuss issues as a team. We will take the majority-rules approach in which we agree to the majority’s decisions. 
* If we cannot settle conflicts on our own, we will seek advice from the instructor.

#### **Missed Deadlines** 
* If a team member misses a deadline, she will be contacted by the team leader. The two will then set a new deadline for the work. 
*	If the team member fails to meet the new deadline, the team leader will notify the instructor of the situation. 
*	In cases of emergency/severe circumstances, the team leader will request a deadline extension from the instructor 24 hours before the deadline. 

#### **Unacceptable Work** 
*	If a team member submits unacceptable work (e.g., incomplete work, work that does not meet the instructor’s requirements, work that does not meet team standards), the team leader will contact the member and provide suggestions for revision. The team leader and member will agree upon a deadline for resubmission. 
*	If team members deem the team leader’s work unacceptable, they will also contact the team leader to suggest revisions.
